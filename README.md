# my code snippets

It's my repository to store some of the algorithms and snippets of code that I did to improve my JS skills.
All of the scripts that I did came from the [freeCodeCamp JS algorithms certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), which I strongly recommend!
