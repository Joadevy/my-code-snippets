# my code snippets

It's my repository to store some of the algorithms and snippets of code that I did to improve my JS skills.

## Documentation

- freeCodeCamp-scripts has a variety of interesting scripts that I've done while I did the [freeCodeCamp JS algorithms certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), which I strongly recommend!. In every one, I added comments to help people (and myself in the future) understand what exactly the code does.

## Roadmap

- Add code-snippets and JS scripts
- Improve documentation
- Completed challenges and certifications with JS or others.
